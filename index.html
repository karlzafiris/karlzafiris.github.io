            Hello there! My name is Karl, and I'm a software engineer based in Patras, Greece. From a very young age, I immersed myself in the world of computer science and engineering, eventually discovering my true passion: programming and architecture design. Over the years, I've delivered effective solutions across a wide range of sectors, from simple blogs and e-commerce platforms to complex enterprise resource planning systems and medical care platforms.
